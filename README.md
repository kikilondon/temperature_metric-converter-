Temperature Metric Converter 
The project is a temperature metric converter.
First, the user enters the scale he wants to measure the temperature and then the number of degrees to convert.
Then the programme converts the entered figure into Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin degrees based on the user's choice.
I built it with Javascript and HTML.
